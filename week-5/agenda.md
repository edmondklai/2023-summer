# Week 5

## Review

### Practice for loop

Easy

1. print out 20 numbers that is greater than zero
2. print out all the odds number that is less than 100
3. print out all the numbers from 0 to 100 that is both divisible by 3 and 5
4. print out all the numbers from 0 to 100 that is either divisible by 7 or divisble by 10

Medium

1. Create a function, use a loop to compute all the natural numbers that is less than 10
2. FizzBuzz - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and for multiples of ‘3’ print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of ‘5’ print “Buzz”.

Hard

1. Create a function, use a loop, to return the largest integer, where the integer square is less than 100

Super hard

1. Create a function that print out the fibonacci sequence to the n term

## Array

Array is a list of items, it can be a list of numbers, strings, boolean, array

```js
const names = ["Ed", "David", "Jimmy", "HaoZhi"];
const scores = [85, 83, 91, 78];
```

Practice

- Print out an array of colors
- Print out an array of sports
- Print out an array of temperatures

Properties of array

- Length

```js
console.log(names.length);
```

Index of array

index is the location of where an element of the array is located

```js
const names = ["Ed", "David", "Jimmy", "HaoZhi"];
const scores = [85, 83, 91, 78];

names[0];

scores[3];

name[5];
```

## HTML / CSS / JS

We will apply some of the JS concepts we've learned and use it in our website.
Copy the template from week-5

## Loop through

- create a list of concepts you learned in this class, and show in the html using loops

- show only scores that are greater than 80

- show name that has more than 3 characters
